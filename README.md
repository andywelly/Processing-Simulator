Computer Systems Project: Process and Memory Management Simulator

**Overview:**

This project simulates a process manager that handles process scheduling and memory management. It implements a round-robin scheduler with various memory allocation strategies, including infinite memory, contiguous memory allocation (First Fit), paged memory allocation, and virtual memory allocation. The program reads process information from an input file, simulates their execution, and outputs an execution transcript and performance statistics.
